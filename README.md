## Description

The course **CSE 251 Programming in C** from Michigan State University is one of my favourite courses.It's very good for me to learn the C programming language.This repository contains the labs and projects I did in the course **CSE 251 Programming in C**.

> The course page is https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse251/index.html.



The hard point is that some project**(e.g. step10，step14，project2)** must be compiled and executed on the lab machine at Michigan State University.But I found a way to do it in my personal machine.I had wrote down the way in **How to constructe the operating environment.md**
